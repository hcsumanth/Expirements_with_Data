# Expirements_with_Data
Algorithms, Data Structures, Statistics, Machine Learning and more 

Learning Data Science is very easy when you can shed loads of money to a course and get a certificate and probably work on solving real life problems. Another method is by winning a competetions on Kaggle and other places similar which anyway would need a lot of research to break on to the top and the leaderboard is easily corrupted by the noise of people actually building models to running kernels.

A long, boring and hard method is to go through implementing the models to understand the nature of "How the Things work" and on the better hand understand to write code to use algorithms and bring the big picture. With a lot of inputs from the Ocean called Internet I found the following:

+ Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition by Thoms Coreman et all http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition brings solid material to understand the Algorithms.
+ Machine Learning by Andrew NG is one of the best place for Machne Learning course 
+ Tensorflow is a powerful Python library for Deep Learning
